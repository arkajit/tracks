1. Make figures similar to 3.9 and 3.10, but now vary the transition probability
between states instead of varying the Vmax and Dmax.

2. For all of the rolling MSD figures (figures 3.11, 3.13, 3.14, 3.15, 3.18),
you should show results for two or three different window sizes.  Use the
current window size (which gives noisy results) and one or two larger window
sizes (so that the largest one gives low noise but gradual transitions).

3. Make a version of the MSD fitting approach that allows V and D at the same 
time (i.e. fit the MSD vs. timelag data, still within a sliding window along the track, 
with the velocity plus flow model MSD = v^2 * t^2 + 6Dt and report the fit values of 
V and D).

4. Repeat tests on simulated tracks of the same length and expected transitions as 
the chromosome tracks (~100 steps total, with one transition from 0 velocity to 3 um/min 
velocity, then a second transition to 10 um/min velocity, then a third transition back to 0
velocity).

5. Run your algorithm on the chromosome trajectories and plot V and D states vs
time for each chromosome.  I've attached a .mat file with the tracks from one
experiment.  The tracks matrix is the usual 6 columns, with all 25 tracks in the
same matrix.  The X,Y,Z coordinates are in um and the time coordinate (last
column) is in frame number.  What I usually do to plot the tracks is plot the
distance between the current track position and the pole (given in
info.manualpole) versus the time after nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD), which
you can calculate using the frame number at which NEBD occurs (info.nebd) and
the time between frames in seconds (info.timestep).  See the attached figure,
which came from these tracks.  You could make a similar plot with all the
chromosomes' V states on the y axis and time after NEBD on the x axis.  For your
algorithm, try using Vmax = 12 um/min = 0.2 um/s and Dmax = 0.1 um^2/s.
