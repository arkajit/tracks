Research Questions
==================

- Consolidate towards a paper draft (with unbiased presentation of the other
  methods) with a more final set of figures. 
	Show what you have and list the next steps and the benefits of them.
	Target paper draft ready to submit by Spring Break. Perhaps to BMC
	Bioinformatics?

- Make a working version where people can submit tracks and we can output
  results. Make lcbb.mit.edu/tracks. Need to get access to server.

- Reread vbfret paper and look at vbfret.sourceforge.net and
  http://bio.physics.illinois.edu/.

Goal: Improve Model Selection and how we LEARN the best model.

	- Make figures similar to 3.9 and 3.10, but now vary the transition probability
		between states instead of varying the Vmax and Dmax. 

	- Explore smarter model selection approaches as well.

	- Can we use recursive binning to get more accurate results? Or perhaps use
  estimates from MSD approaches as a starting point for Dmax and Vmax?
	
	- What about using multivariate Gaussian emissions to have a single HMM for 3D
	  step emissions instead of 3 HMMs for 1D emissions

Goal: Accurate Presentation and Writeup.

	- For all of the rolling MSD figures (figures 3.11, 3.13, 3.14, 3.15, 3.18),
		you should show results for two or three different window sizes.  Use the
		current window size (which gives noisy results) and one or two larger window
		sizes (so that the largest one gives low noise but gradual transitions).
		Also, you could consider a max window size dictated by how often transitions
		happen between D,V states. 

	- Generate a graph of deltaTs vs deltaVs where deltaT is the time to transition
  	when there is a deltaV change in the x velocity. Last attempt was buggy.
  	Rethink.

Goal: Show useful application of your method.

	- Repeat tests on simulated tracks of the same length and expected transitions as 
		the chromosome tracks (~100 steps total, with one transition from 0 velocity to 3 um/min 
		velocity, then a second transition to 10 um/min velocity, then a third transition back to 0
		velocity).

	- Run your algorithm on the chromosome trajectories and plot V and D states vs
		time for each chromosome.  I've attached a .mat file with the tracks from one
		experiment.  The tracks matrix is the usual 6 columns, with all 25 tracks in the
		same matrix.  The X,Y,Z coordinates are in um and the time coordinate (last
		column) is in frame number.  What I usually do to plot the tracks is plot the
		distance between the current track position and the pole (given in
		info.manualpole) versus the time after nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD), which
		you can calculate using the frame number at which NEBD occurs (info.nebd) and
		the time between frames in seconds (info.timestep).  See the attached figure,
		which came from these tracks.  You could make a similar plot with all the
		chromosomes' V states on the y axis and time after NEBD on the x axis.  For your
		algorithm, try using Vmax = 12 um/min = 0.2 um/s and Dmax = 0.1 um^2/s.

	- Consider adding noise to the step observations and improving the models to
		support this. When generating trajectory, add a noise element drawn from 
		N(0, \sigma_err).

	- Can we try a ramp change application? where the velocity changes gradually?

	- Also can we effectively distinguish small velocity changes? between varying
  	diffusion coefficient and time-varying velocity? should we care about these?
