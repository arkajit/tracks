Research Questions
==================

- Consolidate towards a paper draft (with unbiased presentation of the other
  methods) with a more final set of figures. 
	Show what you have and list the next steps and the benefits of them.
	Target paper draft ready to submit by Spring Break. Perhaps to BMC
	Bioinformatics?

- Make a working version where people can submit tracks and we can output
  results. Make lcbb.mit.edu/tracks. Need to get access to server.

- Reread vbfret paper and look at vbfret.sourceforge.net and
  http://bio.physics.illinois.edu/.

- Make figures similar to 3.9 and 3.10, but now vary the transition probability
between states instead of varying the Vmax and Dmax.

- For all of the rolling MSD figures (figures 3.11, 3.13, 3.14, 3.15, 3.18),
you should show results for two or three different window sizes.  Use the
current window size (which gives noisy results) and one or two larger window
sizes (so that the largest one gives low noise but gradual transitions).
Also, you could consider a max window size dictated by how often transitions
happen between D,V states.

- Make a version of the MSD fitting approach that allows V and D at the same 
time (i.e. fit the MSD vs. timelag data, still within a sliding window along the track, 
with the velocity plus flow model MSD = v^2 * t^2 + 6Dt and report the fit values of 
V and D).

- Generate a graph of deltaTs vs deltaVs where deltaT is the time to transition
  when there is a deltaV change in the x velocity. Last attempt was buggy.
  Rethink.

- Repeat tests on simulated tracks of the same length and expected transitions as 
the chromosome tracks (~100 steps total, with one transition from 0 velocity to 3 um/min 
velocity, then a second transition to 10 um/min velocity, then a third transition back to 0
velocity).

- Run your algorithm on the chromosome trajectories and plot V and D states vs
time for each chromosome.  I've attached a .mat file with the tracks from one
experiment.  The tracks matrix is the usual 6 columns, with all 25 tracks in the
same matrix.  The X,Y,Z coordinates are in um and the time coordinate (last
column) is in frame number.  What I usually do to plot the tracks is plot the
distance between the current track position and the pole (given in
info.manualpole) versus the time after nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD), which
you can calculate using the frame number at which NEBD occurs (info.nebd) and
the time between frames in seconds (info.timestep).  See the attached figure,
which came from these tracks.  You could make a similar plot with all the
chromosomes' V states on the y axis and time after NEBD on the x axis.  For your
algorithm, try using Vmax = 12 um/min = 0.2 um/s and Dmax = 0.1 um^2/s.

- Consider adding noise to the step observations and improving the models to
support this.
When generating trajectory, add a noise element drawn from N(0, \sigma_err).

- Explore smarter model selection approaches as well.

- Can we use recursive binning to get more accurate results? Or perhaps use
  estimates from MSD approaches as a starting point for Dmax and Vmax?

- Can we try a ramp change application? where the velocity changes gradually?

- Also can we effectively distinguish small velocity changes? between varying
  diffusion coefficient and time-varying velocity? should we care about these?

Code Improvement
================

- Write more tests / sample scripts.
- Generalize the plot visualizations in TrackExperiments to make it easy to
  compare two or more predictions for timeseries
